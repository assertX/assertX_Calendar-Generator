# assertX_Calendar_Generator
This was the first Java Project of the semester
In this project, you are going to write a Java program that generates a calendar and show it in the console.

Your program asks the user to enter 3 input values (see below) via keyboard.

•Year.  The user should enter a 4-digit year (e.g., 1997, 2022), which should be stored as an int.

•Month.  The user should enter a 1- or 2-digit month (between 1 and 12).  For example, "5" means May and "11" means November.

•Day-of-week of the first day of the month.  The user should enter the day-of-week of the first day of "that year" (input year) "that month" (input month).  The user should enter a 3-character string as a day-of-week.  For example, "Mon" means Monday and "Thu" means Thursday.  This input value is not case-sensitive, which means that "Mon", "MON", and "mon" are all valid.

In this project, you can assume that the user will always enter the correct day-of-week of the first day of the input year and month.  You do not need to worry about incorrect input values.
